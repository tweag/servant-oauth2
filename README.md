# servant-oauth2-combinator

#### Todo

- [ ] Show an example of multiple auths (distinguish by type)
- [x] See if we can get away with only doing it for `complete`
- [x] Pass settings through somehow
- [x] Try and hide away as much details as possible
- [x] Define a basic structure following `AuthProtect`
