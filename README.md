# servant-oauth2

This is a modern servant wrapper around the
[wai-middleware-auth](https://github.com/fpco/wai-middleware-auth) OAuth2
provider implementations.


#### Hacking

Simplest example:

```
./hack example-basic
```

Cookie example:
```
./hack example-cookies
```

#### Before running

You'll need to make a GitHub OAuth application.

The details of which you'll need to place in `./config.toml`. See
`./config.example.toml` for an example.

The most important detail is that the callback URL on github, and in the
config, is set to the same thing:

```
http://localhost:8080/auth/github/complete
```

#### Todo

- [ ] Document exported functions
- [ ] More detailed readme documentation
- [ ] Build in an example of 'Authorisation'; i.e. lifting the logins to the
  type-level
- [ ] CI
- [ ] Contributing guide
- [ ] Refactor `wai-middleware-auth` to be more convenient
- [x] Show an example of multiple auths (distinguish by type)
- [x] See if we can get away with only doing it for `complete`
- [x] Pass settings through somehow
- [x] Try and hide away as much details as possible
- [x] Define a basic structure following `AuthProtect`
