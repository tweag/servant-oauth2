# servant-oauth2-examples

A collection of examples for how to use this library. Implemented in a library
so that you can browse the docs online:

- <https://tweag.github.io/servant-oauth2/servant-oauth2-examples/>

But note that [due to a bug in
haddock](https://github.com/haskell/haddock/issues/1502) you're better off
just reading the sources directly.

See the [top-level readme](../README.md) for running instructions.
